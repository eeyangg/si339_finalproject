            <h1>Hi. I'm Elizabeth Yang</h1>
            <p>I am currently a senior at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science in the College of Engineering and graduating in April 2023. In the last 4 years of my college career, I've gotten the opportunity to advance my technical knowledge and expertise through classes and internship experiences. 
              Outside of coding, my favorite things to do include making art and traveling to new places with my friends and family. Feel free to explore my website by navigating through the different tabs to learn more about me, both professionally and personally!</p>
